## Reporting bugs

### Before creating an issue:
* Check that the bug hasn't been reported in an existing issue. View similar issues to the left of the submit button.
* Make sure you are running the latest version of the code. Pull the most recent changes from the main branch before contributing.

### When creating an issue:
* Use a clear and descriptive title.
* Please provide detailed instructions on how to reproduce the bug, if possible.
* Describe the expected vs. actual behavior
* Include your OS, Go Version, and any relevant environment details.
* Provide logs, screenshots, or error messages if available

## Requesting features
Feature requests are always welcome. Note that not all requests will receive an immediate response.

### Before submitting a feature request:
* Before submitting, **please check the [Validations Table](README.md#validations-table)** in the README to see whether a specific validation is already implemented, planned, or will not be implemented.
* Check that the feature hasn't already been requested. Look at all issues with titles that might be related to the feature.
* Make sure you are running the latest version of the code, as the feature may already have been added. 

### When submitting a feature request:
* Be specific! The more details, the better.
* Small requests are fine, even if itâ€™s just adding support for a minor validation rule or a small enhancement.
* Include any relevant context, examples, or use cases to help us understand the need.
* Make sure your request is not a duplicate by searching the issue tracker first.

## Contributing code

### Before submitting a pull request:
* Familiarise yourself with the code base [here](.github/copilot-instructions.md) to get you started.

### When submitting a pull request:
* Create a new branch in your fork with a descriptive name, preferably including the issue number or the feature you are working on (e.g., 71-feat-contribution-guide).
* Make sure that the changes have been thoroughly tested!
* Open the Pull Request against the main branch of the original repository.
* Keep your commits clear and focused; small, self-contained changes are easier to review.
* If your PR updates documentation or adds new files, make sure all relevant files are included.
